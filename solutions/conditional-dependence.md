## Exercise 1: Epidemiology

> Imagine that you are an epidemiologist and you are determining people's cause of death.
> In this simplified world, there are two main diseases, cancer and the common cold.
> People rarely have cancer, $$p( \text{cancer}) = 0.00001$$, but when they do have cancer, it is often fatal, $$p( \text{death} \mid \text{cancer} ) = 0.9$$.
> People are much more likely to have a common cold, $$p( \text{cold} ) = 0.2$$, but it is rarely fatal, $$p( \text{death} \mid \text{cold} ) = 0.00006$$.
> Very rarely, people also die of other causes $$p(\text{death} \mid \text{other}) = 0.000000001$$.
> 
> Write this model in WebPPL and use `Infer` to answer these questions (Be sure to include your code in your answer):

### a)

> Compute $$p( \text{cancer} \mid \text{death} , \text{cold} )$$ and $$p( \text{cancer} \mid \text{death} , \text{no cold} )$$.
> How do these probabilities compare to $$p( \text{cancer} \mid \text{death} )$$ and $$p( \text{cancer} )$$?
> Using these probabilities, give an example of explaining away.

| Event                     | Prob |
| ------------------------- | ---- |
| Prior                   | 0.00001|
| Given death             | 0.42855| 
| Given death and cold    | 0.13043|
| Given death and no cold | 0.99989| 

Having a cold explains away the death.
Given only the information that a person died, cancer is relatively likely.
When we learn the person also had a cold, this probability of cancer goes down, not down to prior levels, but pretty unlikely.
If we instead learn that the person died and did not have a cold, we become almost certain that the person died of cancer.

Having cancer *really* explains away the death.
Given only the information that a person died, a cold is very likely.
When we learn the person also had cancer, this probability goes back down to almost exactly the prior.
If we instead learn that the person *didn't* have cancer, we become almost certain they died of a cold.
