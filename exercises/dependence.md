## Exercise 1: Causal and statistical dependency.

For each of the following programs:

* Draw the dependency diagram (Bayes net). If you don't have software on your computer for doing this, Google Docs has a decent interface for creating drawings.

* Use informal evaluation order reasoning and the intervention method to determine causal dependency between A and B.

* Use conditioning to determine whether A and B are statistically dependent.

### a)

~~~~ 
var a = flip();
var b = flip();
var c = flip(a && b ? .8 : .5);
~~~~

### b)

~~~~ 
var a = flip();
var b = flip(a ? .9 : .2);
var c = flip(b ? .7 : .1);
~~~~

### c)

~~~~ 
var a = flip();
var b = flip(a ? .9 : .2);
var c = flip(a ? .7 : .1);
~~~~

### d)

~~~~ 
var a = flip(.6);
var c = flip(.1);
var z = flip() ? a : c;
var b = z ? 'foo' : 'bar';
~~~~

### e)

~~~~ 
var examFairPrior = Bernoulli({p: .8});
var doesHomeworkPrior = Bernoulli({p: .8});
var examFair = mem(function(exam) { return sample(examFairPrior) });
var doesHomework = mem(function(student) { return sample(doesHomeworkPrior) });

var pass = function(student, exam) {
  return flip(examFair(exam) ?
              (doesHomework(student) ? .9 : .5) :
              (doesHomework(student) ? .2 : .1));
}
var a = pass('alice', 'historyExam');
var b = pass('bob', 'historyExam');
