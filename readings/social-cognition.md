## 1. Generics & Rational Speech Acts

Read [this chapter](http://www.problang.org/chapters/07-generics.html) from another WebPPL textbook that extends the scalar implicature model we saw in the chapter to handle generics.

#### Reading questions:
a) How does the notion of 'informativity' help the model determine a meaning for generics?

From ChatGPT:

> Informativity refers to the amount of new information conveyed by a statement. In the context of generics, informativity is used to determine the likelihood of a statement being true. A more informative generic statement is one that is true for a higher percentage of the members of the category being referred to, while a less informative statement is one that is only true for a smaller percentage of the category.
> 
> The scalar implicature model uses informativity to determine the meaning of generics by considering the probability of a statement being true based on its informativity. The model reasons that a more informative generic statement is more likely to be true and uses this information to determine the meaning of the statement. For example, if the statement "Dogs are loyal" is more informative, meaning that a higher percentage of dogs are indeed loyal, the model will use this information to determine the meaning of the statement.

b) How does this model reinterpret the relationship between what a sentence "literally" means, and what it implies?

ChatGPT tries really, really hard on this one:

> In the scalar implicature model, the relationship between the literal meaning of a sentence and what it implies is reinterpreted in terms of probabilistic reasoning. In this model, the literal meaning of a sentence is represented as a probability distribution over the space of possible meanings, and the implicatures are computed based on these probabilities and the context in which the sentence is used.

> For example, consider the sentence "Some dogs are loyal." The literal meaning of this sentence is represented as a probability distribution over the set of all possible worlds, with each world being a possible scenario in which the sentence is true. The model would use this probability distribution to compute the scalar implicatures of the sentence, which represent the additional information that is conveyed by the sentence beyond its literal meaning.

> In this way, the scalar implicature model reinterprets the relationship between the literal meaning of a sentence and its implicatures as a probabilistic relationship. The literal meaning of a sentence is represented as a probability distribution over possible meanings, and the implicatures are computed based on this distribution and the context in which the sentence is used. The result is a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between what a sentence "literally" means and what it implies, based on probabilistic reasoning and taking into account the context in which the sentence is used.

c) To understand "birds lay eggs," the model assumes that people know the actual distributions of various properties across the animal kingdom. This is not realistic. Does that invalidate the model? 

ChatGPT's thoughts on the matter:

> This limitation of the model does not necessarily invalidate the model, but rather highlights the fact that models of language understanding, like any other models, make simplifying assumptions that may not perfectly reflect reality. The purpose of models like this is to provide a simplified representation of reality that allows for testing and exploration of certain questions and theories related to language understanding.


## 2. Natural pedagogy

@Shafto:2012by

#### Reading questions:

a) The model in the reading invokes a theory of mind (learners are reasoning about teachers' mental states) but a relatively simple theory of mind (the kinds of mental states ascribed are not complex). Would this be sufficient for learning more complex ideas (like mathematics or how to tune a bicycle)? If not, what might you want to add to the learner's theory of mind? 

As usual, ChatGPT has some thoughts:

> The model in "Learning From Others: The Consequences of Psychological Reasoning for Human Learning" by Pat Shafto and colleagues uses a relatively simple theory of mind, which focuses on reasoning about teachers' mental states to facilitate learning. However, this simple theory of mind may not be sufficient for learning more complex ideas such as mathematics or how to tune a bicycle. To enhance the learner's theory of mind in these cases, additional components may be necessary, such as the ability to infer the teacher's goals, beliefs, and intentions, as well as an understanding of how the teacher's mental states relate to the task at hand. Additionally, the ability to reason about one's own mental states, such as self-awareness, may also play a role in learning complex ideas.

## 3. Adjectives & Rational Speech Acts

Start by reading @schmidt2009tall, which provides some background on the basic problem. Then read @lassiter2017adjectival to see how the Rational Speech Act model can be applied to this problem.

#### Reading questions:
a) How does the notion of 'informativity' help Lassiter and Goodman's model determine the meaning for gradable adjectives?

b) Do you think Lassiter and Goodman's model should be understood as a processing model that explains how people interpret gradable adjectives in real time? Why or why not? 

## 4. Making decisions about ethics.

In the main chapter, the scenarios the agent had to consider were very simple. Real-life decision-making is much more complex. Read "[Inference of intention and permissibility in moral decision making](https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2015/papers/0199/paper0199.pdf)" by Max Kleiman-Weiner, Tobias Gerstenberg, Sydney Levine, and Joshua Tenenbaum.

#### Reading questions:
a) How do influence diagrams allow the agent to reason about actions? What do these allow that goes beyond what we saw in the chapter?

ChatGPT provides an excellent example of an answer that is both more-or-less true and completely useless:

> Influence diagrams are a graphical representation of the probabilistic relationships between variables in a decision-making process.

> In this paper, the authors use influence diagrams to model an agent's reasoning about actions in moral decision-making scenarios. The influence diagrams allow the agent to reason about the relationships between different factors that influence its decision-making process, such as the intention behind an action, the permissibility of an action, and the outcomes of an action. By using influence diagrams, the agent can take into account multiple factors and their probabilistic relationships when making a decision, leading to a more nuanced understanding of the decision-making process.

> Influence diagrams allow the agent to reason about actions in a way that goes beyond what was presented in the Social Cognition chapter of Probabilistic Models of Cognition. While the scenarios in the Social Cognition chapter were relatively simple, influence diagrams provide a more flexible and expressive way of modeling the relationships between variables in more complex decision-making scenarios. This allows the agent to take into account multiple factors and their probabilistic relationships when making a decision, leading to a more nuanced understanding of the decision-making process.

> In conclusion, the use of influence diagrams in moral decision making allows an agent to reason about actions in a more complex and nuanced way, taking into account multiple factors and their probabilistic relationships. This provides a more flexible and expressive way of modeling the relationships between variables in decision-making scenarios, beyond what was presented in the Social Cognition chapter of Probabilistic Models of Cognition.

b) What theoretical questions was the model intended to explore? What modeling assumptions are tangential to the investigation?

ChatGPT's answer:

> To explore these questions, the authors made a number of modeling assumptions. First, they assumed that people make decisions based on the influence of multiple factors, such as the intention behind an action, the permissibility of an action, and the outcomes of an action. Second, they assumed that the relationships between these factors are probabilistic in nature. Third, they assumed that the decision-making process is influenced by prior beliefs and biases.

> These assumptions are tangential to the investigation as they form the basis for the model and help to capture the complexity of moral decision making. By taking into account multiple factors and their probabilistic relationships, the model provides a more nuanced understanding of the decision-making process, beyond what would be possible with simpler models.

## Extras
### Extra psychology
* **Theory of Mind**. For more on Theory of Mind, see @carlson:2013theory.

* **Gricean Theory**. The scalar implicature theory (and RSA in general) are derived from earlier philosophical work by H. Paul Grice. The wikipedia article on the [Cooperative Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_principle) provides an excellent overview of Gricean Theory. "[Experimental pragmatics: A Gricean turn in the study of language](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.233.1679&rep=rep1&type=pdf)" by Ira Noveck and Anne Reboul provides a very accessible discussion of psychological research up through 2008.

* **Expected Utility**. The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy provides a [useful introduction](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rationality-normative-utility/) to the notion of "expected utility", which plays a major role in many approaches to decision-making.
