## 1. Natural pedagogy

@Shafto:2012by

#### Reading questions:

a) The model in the reading invokes a theory of mind (learners are reasoning about teachers' mental states) but a relatively simple theory of mind (the kinds of mental states ascribed are not complex). Would this be sufficient for learning more complex ideas (like mathematics or how to tune a bicycle)? If not, what might you want to add to the learner's theory of mind? 

As usual, ChatGPT has some thoughts:

> The model in "Learning From Others: The Consequences of Psychological Reasoning for Human Learning" by Pat Shafto and colleagues uses a relatively simple theory of mind, which focuses on reasoning about teachers' mental states to facilitate learning. However, this simple theory of mind may not be sufficient for learning more complex ideas such as mathematics or how to tune a bicycle. To enhance the learner's theory of mind in these cases, additional components may be necessary, such as the ability to infer the teacher's goals, beliefs, and intentions, as well as an understanding of how the teacher's mental states relate to the task at hand. Additionally, the ability to reason about one's own mental states, such as self-awareness, may also play a role in learning complex ideas.
