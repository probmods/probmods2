## 1. Overview of Bayesian computational models

Read "[How to Grow a Mind: Statistics, Structure, and Abstraction](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/331/6022/1279)" by Joshua B. Tenenbaum, Charles Kemp, Thomas L. Griffiths, and Noah D. Goodman. This provides an overview of the approach taken by many of the models we'll be looking at.

#### Reading questions:
a) How do Bayesian computational models differ from other kinds of reasoning systems you may be familiar with (formal logic, algebra, connectionism, deep learning, etc.)?

## Extras

* **Background in Psychology**. Readers who have little background in psychology may find it useful to read *How the Mind Works* by Steven Pinker. Although it is getting on in years, it remains an excellent introduction to basic psychological phenomena and theory. 

* **Javascript**. Experienced programmers who need an introduction to Javascript may find the [appendix on Javascript](13-appendix-js-basics.html) sufficient. Students who have limited experience programming are encouraged to check out [*Introduction to JavaScript*](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript) from Codeacademy (esp. Chapters 1-8). 

* **Background in Mathematics**. This textbook requires a basic understanding of probability theory. The Khan Academy has a [gentle introduction](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/probability-library) that should be sufficient for most students.
