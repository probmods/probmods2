title: Conditional Dependence - Readings
description: Conditional dependence.
---

## 1. Models of causal reasoning

Read "[Hierarchical Bayesian inference in the visual cortex](https://leelab.cnbc.cmu.edu/publication/assets/links/hierachical.pdf)" by Tai Sing Lee and David Mumford. 

#### Reading questions:

a) Which of Marr's levels are Lee and Mumford targetting? 

b) Describe one or two ways in which the model relates to the content from the chapter.

c) Lee and Mumford's model involves both bottom-up and top-down reasoning. What computational problem does this pose, and how do particle filters help?

## Optional

To learn more about how discussions of causal, statistical, and conditional dependence have informed developmental psychology, read "[A theory of causal learning in children: causal maps and Bayes nets](https://pages.ucsd.edu/~rlevy/gopnik-etal-2004.pdf)" by Alison Gopnik and colleagues. 

## Extras

* If you are unfamiliar with the terms "top-down" and "bottom-up" processing, read [this](https://www.simplypsychology.org/top-down-processing.html#:~:text=Top%2Ddown%20processing%20is%20perceiving,beliefs%2C%20values%20and%20social%20influences.) and [this](https://www.simplypsychology.org/bottom-up-processing.html#:~:text=Bottom%2Dup%20processing%20is%20the%20process%20of%20'sensation'%2C,organize%2C%20and%20interpret%20these%20sensations).
