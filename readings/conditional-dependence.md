## 1. Models of causal reasoning

Read "[Hierarchical Bayesian inference in the visual cortex](https://web.archive.org/web/20170810151948id_/http://cvcl.mit.edu/SUNSeminar/LeeMumford2003.pdf)" by Tai Sing Lee and David Mumford. 

#### Reading questions:

a) Which of Marr's levels are Lee and Mumford targeting? 

Here's what ChatGPT says:

>In the paper "Hierarchical Bayesian inference in the visual cortex" by Tai Sing Lee and David Mumford, the authors are targeting the computational level of Marr's levels of analysis.

b) Describe one or two ways in which the model relates to the content from the chapter.

With a little bit of help, ChatGPT can produce this:

>The "Hierarchical Bayesian inference in the visual cortex" model by Tai Sing Lee and David Mumford relates to the content in Chapter 4 of Probabilistic Models of Cognition in the following ways:
>
>Bayesian models of cognition: Chapter 4 of Probabilistic Models of Cognition covers Bayesian models of cognition, which are mathematical models that use Bayesian probability theory to explain how people process and make inferences about sensory information. Lee and Mumford's model of hierarchical Bayesian inference in the visual cortex fits within this framework, as it proposes that the visual cortex performs Bayesian inference to infer the most likely explanation of sensory input based on prior knowledge and context.
>
>Hierarchical models: The hierarchical aspect of Lee and Mumford's model is also relevant to the content in Chapter 4, as the chapter covers the use of hierarchical models in probabilistic models of cognition. Hierarchical models enable the modeling of complex, multi-level processes by breaking them down into simpler, more manageable components. In the case of Lee and Mumford's model, the hierarchy refers to the levels of abstraction in the visual cortex, from lower-level features to higher-level object representations.
>
>These similarities highlight how Lee and Mumford's model fits within the broader framework of probabilistic models of cognition, and how it contributes to our understanding of how the visual cortex performs inferences and processes sensory information.

c) Lee and Mumford's model involves both bottom-up and top-down reasoning. What computational problem does this pose, and how do particle filters help?

From ChatGPT:

>The "Hierarchical Bayesian inference in the visual cortex" model by Tai Sing Lee and David Mumford involves both bottom-up and top-down reasoning, which poses a computational challenge. Bottom-up reasoning refers to the processing of sensory information starting from the most basic features, while top-down reasoning refers to the use of prior knowledge and context to guide processing. This combination of bottom-up and top-down reasoning creates a highly complex inference problem, as the visual cortex must balance the influence of sensory data with prior knowledge and context to make accurate inferences about the visual scene.
>
>Particle filters help to address this computational problem by providing a probabilistic framework for combining bottom-up and top-down information. Particle filters are a type of Monte Carlo method that generates a set of particle estimates of the state of a system. In the case of the visual cortex, these particles represent different hypotheses about the explanation of the sensory input, taking into account both bottom-up and top-down information. The visual cortex then uses Bayesian inference to update the particle estimates based on the new sensory information and refine its inferences about the visual scene.
>
>In this way, particle filters provide a way to balance bottom-up and top-down information in a computationally efficient manner, enabling the visual cortex to perform complex inferences about the visual scene based on a combination of sensory data and prior knowledge.

## Optional

To learn more about how discussions of causal, statistical, and conditional dependence have informed developmental psychology, read "[A theory of causal learning in children: causal maps and Bayes nets](https://pages.ucsd.edu/~rlevy/gopnik-etal-2004.pdf)" by Alison Gopnik and colleagues.

If you tell ChatGPT you don't have enough background to understand this paper, here's what it suggests. I can't say that it's wrong, but it's not very helpful:

>If you don't have a strong background in the topics covered in the paper "Hierarchical Bayesian inference in the visual cortex" by Tai Sing Lee and David Mumford, I recommend starting with the following resources:
>
>Introduction to Bayesian Statistics: Bayesian statistics is the mathematical framework used in the paper, and understanding the basics of Bayesian statistics is essential for comprehending the model. There are many resources available online to help you learn about Bayesian statistics, such as online courses, tutorials, and introductory texts.
>
>Vision and the Visual Cortex: The paper focuses on how the visual cortex performs inferences about visual scenes, so understanding the basics of vision and the visual cortex is also important. You can start by reading introductory texts on vision and the visual cortex, or taking online courses on these topics.
>
>Particle Filters: Particle filters are a specific type of algorithm used in the paper to perform Bayesian inference. Understanding particle filters is key to understanding the computational problem the paper addresses and how it solves it. You can learn about particle filters by reading introductory texts, watching videos, or taking online courses.
>
>Once you have a solid understanding of these basics, you will be better equipped to understand the paper "Hierarchical Bayesian inference in the visual cortex" and its contributions to the field.
