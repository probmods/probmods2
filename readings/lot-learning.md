title: Learning with a Language of Thought - readings
---

## 1. Learning numbers

[Bootstrapping a language of thought](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027711002769) by Piantadosi and colleagues.

This is a long paper. Focus on the first 11 pages (through and including Sec. 4.1).

#### Reading questions:

a) What stages do children go through in learning numbers?

b) Why does the model go through several stages before finally learning the number system?

## Extras

a) For a more thorough review of how children learn numbers, see "[Learning to represent exact numbers](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11229-015-0854-6)" by Barbara Sarnecka.

b) A highly related paper is ["A Bayesian Model of the Acquisition of Compositional Semantics"](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.aab3050). This isn't a language of thought model but applies very similar ideas to the problem of reading handwriting.
