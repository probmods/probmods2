#### Reading questions:

a) The model in the reading invokes a theory of mind (learners are reasoning about teachers' mental states) but a relatively simple theory of mind (the kinds of mental states ascribed are not complex). Would this be sufficient for learning more complex ideas (like mathematics or how to tune a bicycle)? If not, what might you want to add to the learner's theory of mind? 

## Extras
