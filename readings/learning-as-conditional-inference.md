## 1. Learning numbers

@piantadosi2012bootstrapping

This is a long paper. Focus on the first 11 pages (through and including Sec. 4.1).

#### Reading questions:

a) What stages do children go through in learning numbers?

b) Why does the model go through several stages before finally learning the number system?
