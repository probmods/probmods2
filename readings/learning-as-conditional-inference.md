## 1. Word-learning

*Note that if you aren't familiar with plate notation (you'd know if you were), you'll want to read the "extra" on plate notation below before starting the paper.*

Read "[Using speakers' referential intentions to model early cross-situational word learning](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1467-9280.2009.02335.x?casa_token=d6XWPJFydQsAAAAA:jT9BMvSjSZtFbvQRhrBr_pAUdkMsb_lkHHpZyHJad1om08ddsksv7qR8snr1ySEOjUfUuRZDsEKo)" by Frank, Goodman, & Tenenbaum. 
 

#### Reading questions:

a) What is the implicit model of the speaker? First, the speaker does what? Then what? Etc.

b) What are the key differences between the intentional model and the association frequency model? The conditional probability model?

## Extras

* **Plate Notation**: The model is described using plate notation. If this is unfamiliar, read this [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_notation](description from Wikipedia).

* **Word-learning biases**: The paper does a pretty good job of briefly explaining basic phenomena in word-learning like mutual exclusivity. For a bit more detail, see the Wikipedia article on [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_learning_biases](Word learning biases).

* **More Word-learning biases**: For a deeper dive into the theoretical and empirical background informing this paper, read Markman (1990) [Constraints children place on word meanings](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1207/s15516709cog1401_4).
