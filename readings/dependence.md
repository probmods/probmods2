## 1. Models of causal reasoning

In the chapter, we discussed how to reason about causation using generative models. There is a separate question as to how humans actually do reason about causality, and what they mean when they say *A caused B*. Read ["A counterfactual simulation model of causal judgments for physical events"](https://cicl.stanford.edu/papers/gerstenberg2021csm.pdf) by Tobi Gerstenberg, Noah Goodman, David Lagnado, & Joshua Tenenbaum. (You may find it useful to play around with [this causality sandbox](https://scripts.mit.edu/~tger/csm_interface/). 

#### Reading questions:
a) According to Gerstenberg and colleagues, how do human notions of causality match the notion of causal dependence discussed in the chapter? How do they differ?

For the record, here is what ChatGPT says:

>Gerstenberg and colleagues proposed a counterfactual simulation model to account for human causal judgments for physical events. According to their model, human notions of causality align with the notion of causal dependence in that both involve considering the necessary and sufficient conditions for an effect to occur.
>
>However, the model also suggests that human causal judgments are influenced by a range of factors beyond strict causal dependence, such as heuristics, biases, and prior beliefs. These additional factors can lead to differences between human notions of causality and the formal definition of causal dependence.
>
>For example, humans may rely on heuristics such as temporal proximity or covariation, rather than causal relationships, to make causal judgments. Additionally, humans may make causal judgments based on limited or biased information, whereas the definition of causal dependence requires complete and accurate information about the causal relationships between events.
>
>In conclusion, Gerstenberg and colleaguesâ€™ model suggests that human notions of causality match the notion of causal dependence to some extent, but also differ due to the influence of heuristics, biases, and prior beliefs.

b) Gerstenberg and colleagues rely on reasoning through simulation. In what ways is this similar to embodiment or other classic simulation-based theories?

Here is what ChatGPT thinks:

>The "counterfactual simulation model of causal judgments" by Gerstenberg et al. is similar to embodiment and other classic simulation-based theories in that it posits that our understanding of the physical world is based on mental simulations. The authors argue that our causal judgments, or beliefs about what would happen in a hypothetical scenario, are based on simulating the consequences of counterfactual events in our minds. This is similar to embodiment theories, which suggest that our perception and understanding of the world is shaped by the way our body interacts with the environment, and that mental simulations play a key role in this process. Additionally, the simulation-based approach used by Gerstenberg et al. is similar to other classic simulation-based theories, such as mental models theory, which suggest that we build internal representations, or mental models, of the world and use these models to understand and predict the outcomes of events.
