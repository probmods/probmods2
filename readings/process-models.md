Rational Use of Cognitive Resources: Levels of Analysis Between the Computational and the Algorithmic, Griffiths, Lieder, Goodman (2015). 

**One and Done** :One concern about Bayesian models is that inference takes too long. But what if you actually didn't need to run MCMC that long? @vul2014one

# Evolutionary algorithms, Bayesian inference, and the mind

@suchow2017evolution

## Reading questions:

a) In what way is evolutionary dynamics like Bayesian inference?

b) A number of different inference algorithms are discussed. What are the consequences of one of them being used for a particular process (like working memory) as opposed to another one?
