## 1. A Mixture Model of Visual Working Memory

Read "[Contextual effects in visual working memory reveal hierarchically structure memory representations](https://jov.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2471226)" by Timothy Brady and George Alvarez. This paper was a substantial improvement on prior theories of working memory. In those theories, working memory consisted of a discrete number of slots. Using working memory involved sticking pieces of information into a slot until you ran out of slots. Slots could sometimes lose the piece of information (either through failure to maintain or by being kicked out by some new piece of information; the story varied by theory). This theory worked well for some things but failed to capture some really obvious facts about memory. 

#### Reading questions:
a) What kinds of phenomena can this model account for that a simple item-based model cannot?

b) Figure 2A models subjects' responses as a mixture of what? (Don't just copy-and-paste what it says in the figure caption. Explain it in your own words. You may find it helpful to give an example or a metaphor.)

c) According to the description of the "structure representations/hierarchical Bayesian model" in the appendix, that model is both hierarchical and a mixture model. What is the hierarchical part doing? What is the mixture part doing? (That is, if you eliminated the hierarchical component, what would happen? If you eliminated the mixture part, what would happen?) Your answer here can be broad strokes; it need not be technical. 

d) What Marr's level is this paper investigating? Justify your answer.

## Extras

* **Background in Psychology**. If you aren't familiar with the classic distinction between sensory/iconic memory, short-term/working memory, and long-term memory, read [this wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Memory&oldid=1146564225) up until you reach the section "Types". "[Discrete capacity limits in visual working memory](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959438810000437)" provides some context on the debate that the Brady paper is embedded in. If you want a deeper dive in the science of visual memory, "[Visual memory, the long and the short of it: A review of visual working memory and long-term memory](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13414-018-1522-y)" by Mark. W. Schurgin is useful. 

* **Math and Statistics**. For a more general discussion of mixture models, the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mixture_model&oldid=1141109201) is a little dense but has useful links to many related articles and some nice (if succinctly described) examples.
